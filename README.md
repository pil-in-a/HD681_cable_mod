# Superlux HD681 evo female jack modification
Those Superlux are pretty sweet headhones for a bargain. You can find really deep reviews online confirming it. However, there is weak point with dettachable cable being easily broken.

Possible solution:

Model of plastic shroud, which could be 3D printed to modify headphones. When modified, there is 3,5 stereo jack FEMALE connector on headphones side.
